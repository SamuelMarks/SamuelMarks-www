\headleft{Modus Operandi}
Split my life in three: family; medical charity; and business. The unrelated-to-medicine business funds the first two. Focus is on open-source scalable engineering. Recently awarded an in-kind \textbf{grant worth \$3.2M} for neural compute processor access from Google.

\smaller{As a contractor working on unrelated sensor network metric aggregation, showed the largest communications company in Australia how to \textbf{save \$100M;}}\\
%   \item As a full-time employee at 16/17 years old, showed a large Travel
% company how to reduce staff count by 8 (making myself and my
% tech support department redundant);
\smaller{Given the entire top floor of the JP Morgan building to go from nothing to a full product in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) industry (all my subcontractors, including postdoctoral computational linguists)… with the backing of a billionaire family. Company \textbf{acquired by calendly};}\\
\smaller{Built a stock market analytics platform (for a high-net-worth individual);}\\
\smaller{Created deduplication algorithms and databases for helping one large bank\textemdash{}who bought another large bank\textemdash{}to join customer profiles (for a Venture Capital fund, who then proceeded to \textbf{raise \$60M} off this);}\\
\smaller{Engineered a distributed system for a blockchain company (my ‘stock’ in their company has since \textbf{gone up > 16000\%}).}

\textsc{Fellowship}. \textit{Harvard Medical School}. \dates{2021+} \\
\smaller{Here in Cambridge MA:\begin{itemize}
  \item to analyse historical records to develop open-source predictive and interpretive models; and to
  \item initiate new medical diagnostic screening programmes; analyse \& learn from its results; and, perpetually
  \item to run better, bigger screening programmes.
\end{itemize}
I am working with Professor David Friedman (Director of Glaucoma and Medical Director for Clinical Research and Co-Director of the Glaucoma Center of Excellence).
All research is wholly charitable, open-source, and patent-free\ldots{} with a view towards global screening (self-funded through my consultancy).}

\textsc{Doctor of Philosophy} (Medicine). \textit{University of Sydney}. \dates{2015--2020} \\
\smaller{Thesis title: \textit{Facilitating large-scale glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy screening using novel technologies.}} \\
\smaller{Created technologies to facilitate mass-screening for blinding eye diseases glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Namely:
\begin{itemize}
  \item State of the Art \textbf{(SOTA) ML} results for differentiating glaucoma from nonglaucoma using the landmark Blue Mountains Eye Study (BMES) and REFUGE fundus photo datasets
  \item \textbf{SOTA ML} for differentiating DR from healthy on Singapore (GON) and a new dataset we collected (DR SPOC)
  \item \textbf{SOTA ML} for determining whether images are gradable on said new dataset\(\uparrow\)
  \item 7 new smartphone ophthalmoscope designs; compared to the industry (\$6307--\$487); the last two of which were \textbf{under 1¢ [<\$0.01]} each.
  \item eLearning MOOCs to teach the basics of ophthalmoscopy and fundus photo diagnostic interpretation to medical students
  \item Glaucoma risk calculator (online, interactive, with analytics dashboard)
