\headleft{Modus Operandi}
Split my life in three: family; medical charity; and business. The unrelated-to-medicine business funds the first two. Focus is on open-source scalable engineering. Recently awarded an in-kind \textbf{grant worth \$3.2M} for neural compute processor access from Google.

\smaller{As a contractor working on unrelated sensor network metric aggregation, showed the largest communications company in Australia how to \textbf{save \$100M;}}\\
%   \item As a full-time employee at 16/17 years old, showed a large Travel
% company how to reduce staff count by 8 (making myself and my
% tech support department redundant);
\smaller{Given the entire top floor of the JP Morgan building to go from nothing to a full product in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) industry (all my subcontractors, including postdoctoral computational linguists)… with the backing of a billionaire family. Company \textbf{acquired by calendly};}\\
\smaller{Built a stock market analytics platform (for a high-net-worth individual);}\\
\smaller{Created deduplication algorithms and databases for helping one large bank\textemdash{}who bought another large bank\textemdash{}to join customer profiles (for a Venture Capital fund, who then proceeded to \textbf{raise \$60M} off this);}\\
\smaller{Engineered a distributed system for a blockchain company (my ‘stock’ in their company has since \textbf{gone up > 16000\%}).}

\headright{Approach}
Develop open-source: compilers; DevOps; and developer tooling. To speedup development; trivialise portability across platforms (OS; distribution; cloud); facilitate the speedy onboarding of new engineers; in summary: to accelerate the delivery of high quality software.

Engineer new compilers to translate OpenAPI \(\leftrightarrow\) \{Rust; Swift; Kotlin Multiplatform; C; TypeScript; Python\} in order to speedup the development of multi-tier multi-language applications (e.g., mobile apps; web frontends; REST API backends).

Engineer new DevOps / GitOps / MLOps tooling where Docker is optional. Support native: Windows; Linux; macOS; SunOS; HP/UX; z/OS; iOS; and Android. Written in shell\textemdash{}Bourne Shell, Bash, Windows Batch, Microsoft PowerShell\textemdash{}complimented by new package managers in C and Rust.

Research driven, holding a PhD and a fellowship at Harvard. I am a top contributor to Keras, the 2nd most popular Machine Learning framework. C++ contributions sent to both PyTorch and TensorFlow for optimising their vector allocations. I am a Google Developer Expert for Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI GDE); Google also just granted me \$3.2M worth of cloud credits for their TPUs.
